Design systems are an agreement which defines how a company or a set of people working together will build products to ensure consistent user experiences for their customers regardless of the device, product, etc..

Idea behind atomic design is breaking down the components or aspects of our design system into five concepts:

1. Atoms - smallest part of our design system which can exist on its own i.e buttons, inputs, labels, etc..
2. Molecules - a combination of atoms i.e. a search form created with: label, input, and button
3. Organisms - a combination of molecules i.e. navigation bar with a logo, navlinks, and a search form. Another example could be a footer with a logo, social media links, and a copyright notice. Organisms should make sense to the end user and should be able to exist on their own.
4. Templates - a combination of organisms i.e a login page. Sketch a template for your design system by sketching out a representation of what the actual page would look like w/ dummy data. The only only difference between a template and a page is that a template is a representation of a page and a page is the actual page w/ real data.
5. Pages - a combination of templates. Uses real data and is the actual page that the user will see.

Idea is the larger the structure the more meaning it should have to the end user. The smaller the structure the more reusable it should be. One should try to look at a UI an break it down into tiny pieces and develop w/ that mindset

Your job as an engineer would be to translate the guidelines of the design system into reusable code that can be used to create products easily in the future i.e. MDS / Material Design / reusable components in general

Role as an Engineer:

1. Understand the design system by the design team or the company
2. Translate the design system into reusable code
3. Represent components of this design system in your preferred coding language, making sure it's reusable across teams and across products while strictly following the guidelines of the design system.
