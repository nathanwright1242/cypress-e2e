# Dashboard Design Best Practices

1. Know the purpose

   - Who is the dashboard for (audience)?
   - How will this dashboard help w/ decision making?
   - Does it monitor a system?
   - Does it track progress towards a goal?

2. Include only the most important content

   - Do your users need to see all the data? Or is a high level point better

3. Consider the data ink ratio

   - reduce the amount of ink used to display non-data ink i.e. the noise
   - remove gridlines, icons, color, unnecessary labels or anything which doesn't communicate data

4. Round your numbers

   - 1,000,000 is hard to read, 1M is easier

5. Use the most efficient visualizations

   - pie charts and area charts are not as effective as bar charts
   - choosing the right visualization **multiple times is fine** and encouraged. Most commonly used visualizations: numbers, bar charts, line charts, and tables

6. Group related metrics - i.e. put them together

   - if you have a lot of metrics, group them by category

7. Be consistent

   - use the same colors, fonts, and sizes throughout the dashboard
   - use the same visualization for the same type of data i.e. bar charts for both revenue and order tracking

8. Show hierarchy

   - make most important metrics bigger
   - top left corner is the most valuable real estate on the screen

9. Give numbers context

   - compare to a goal, a previous period, or a benchmark
   - be careful not to create noise with too many icons indicating context

10. Use clear labels

    - avoid notes, caveats, and other explanations

11. Remember it's for people

    - It is ok to break design rules if it makes the dashboard more effective

12. Keep evolving

    - the first version will not be the best version
    - keep iterating and improving
